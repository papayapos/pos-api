**Sending request**

### HTTP request headers

- **Content-Type**: application/json
- **Accept**: application/json

***REQUEST DESCRIPTION***

- header must contain access token generated in Papaya POS administration account

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

- body contains data in a form of JSON

```
{}
```

> Currently only way to send request is to use Http POST request on correct endpoint with body containing `action` and `data`.

**Request**

All requests must contain `action` and `request`. Currently there are 3 defined actions for get, create or update, and delete.

In case you want to send empty `data`, you need to put in empty json. In case when `data` is missing in request, API will respond with error and request will be ignored.

**Actions**

| action | description |
| :---   | :---          |
| GET | Fetch data, may use data in request to narrow results |
| UPDATE | Create or update with data provided in request |
| DELETE | Delete objects using data provided in request |

**Example**

You can find examples for each endpoint and action in wiki. This is example of empty `data` with GET `action`.

```json

{
  "action": "GET",
  "data": {}
}
```
